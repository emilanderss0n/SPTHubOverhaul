Turn the hub into a more modern version. This is 100% safe to use, it's only a stylesheet. I have used it for a year, so it's pretty robust. I know this isn't for everyone. But if you're like me and spend a lot of time on the hub, then this is a nice upgrade until we get Forge.

Here is how you use it:

- Install a browser extension for using custom CSS (I use Stylebot, so we will use that here)
- Download the CSS file
- Open Stylebot while being on the hub
- Open the CSS file. Copy all the code inside that file. Paste the CSS into the Stylebot textbox
- Done, you can toggle it on/off with the toggle input in the top of the Stylebot menu
